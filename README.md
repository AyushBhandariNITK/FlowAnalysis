# **Flow Analysis Service with Docker Compose**

## **Overview**
This repository defines a multi-container Docker Compose setup to run a PostgreSQL database, Kafka message broker, and Flow Analysis backend service. The service processes data entries with either in-memory or persistent storage based on configuration.

## **Docker Compose Setup**
The Docker Compose configuration contains three services:
1. **`db`**: PostgreSQL database for data storage.
2. **`flowanalysis`**: Backend service for flow analysis.
3. **`kafka`**: Kafka message broker for communication.

### **Key Features**
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
- **Kafka** for messaging.
- **Flow Analysis** service with configurable data storage (in-memory or persistent).

## **Getting Started**

### **Requirements**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### **Usage**
Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Stop and remove the services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### **Environment Configuration**
Configure the `INMEMORY` variable:
```yaml
INMEMORY: true  # true for in-memory, false for persistent storage
```

### **Service Details**
- **PostgreSQL (`db`)**: Stores application data, exposed on port `5432`.
- **Flow Analysis (`flowanalysis`)**: Interacts with PostgreSQL for data analysis.
- **Kafka (`kafka`)**: Configured for message brokering on ports `9092` and `9094`.

# **Flow Analysis Service with In-Memory Map Approach**

## **Overview**
The **In-Memory Map** approach leverages high-speed data storage by using an in-memory map to handle flow analysis. This method is optimal for scenarios where speed is critical, and data size is manageable within memory limits. Data is stored in a **primary map** and **secondary map**, where data from the primary map is swapped into the secondary map every minute, and the secondary map is cleared.

### **Key Features**
- **Concurrent Data Management**: Uses **thread-safe maps** to ensure data consistency in a multi-threaded environment.
- **Primary & Secondary Maps**: 
  - The **primary map** stores the active data, allowing fast access and processing.
  - The **secondary map** is used to hold historical data, and it's swapped with the primary map periodically to manage memory effectively.
- **Data Rotation**: Every minute, the maps rotate, so the system continuously works with fresh data, avoiding memory buildup.
- **Efficient Performance**: The in-memory approach reduces I/O operations and ensures quick data processing, ideal for real-time data analysis.
- **Memory Efficiency**: The rotating maps mechanism ensures that the memory footprint remains controlled by clearing the secondary map periodically.

### **Disadvantages**
- **Data Loss on Restart**: Since the data is stored only in memory, any service restart results in the loss of data. This is suitable for use cases where transient data is acceptable, but not ideal for long-term storage or recovery after failures.
- **Memory Limitation**: As the data is stored in memory, the approach may hit memory limits if the data size grows too large, making it unsuitable for very large datasets.

### **Service Flow**
1. **Primary Map** stores the data that is actively being processed.
2. **Secondary Map** stores the data from the previous cycle. It is cleared after every map swap.
3. **Map Swap Cycle**: Every minute, the **primary map** becomes the **secondary map**, and a new **primary map** is initialized. This rotation ensures that memory usage is optimized.

### **Use Cases**
This approach is most beneficial in scenarios where:
- **High-Speed Data Processing**: The analysis of fast-changing data requires quick access and processing.
- **Short-Lived Data**: Data that doesn't need to be persisted beyond the current analysis cycle.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Suitable for real-time monitoring and flow analysis where the current state matters more than historical data.

### **Example Flow Analysis Logic**
1. **Data Ingestion**: The service receives data entries (e.g., request counts) and stores them in the primary map.
2. **Data Processing**: The system performs analysis on the data in the primary map.
3. **Map Swap**: Every minute, the primary map is moved to the secondary map, the primary map is cleared, and new data is ingested into the primary map.
4. **Output**: Results from the flow analysis can be processed or sent to Kafka for event-driven handling.

### **Configuration**
In the Docker Compose setup, configure the `INMEMORY` variable to `true` for enabling this approach:

```yaml
INMEMORY: true  # Enable in-memory map approach for flow analysis
```

### **Benefits of In-Memory Approach**
- **Low Latency**: Storing and accessing data in memory eliminates disk I/O, resulting in faster response times.
- **Simpler Architecture**: No need to manage complex database interactions for data storage, simplifying the system design.
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled horizontally by adding more service instances (though data consistency across instances will need to be managed with an external system like Kafka or Redis).

# **Second Approach: Persistent Storage with PVC**

## **Overview**
In this approach, data is stored persistently using **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**, ensuring durability across restarts. This is critical in production environments where data retention is essential, and service restarts or crashes should not result in data loss.

### **Storage Options**
1. **Redis with TTL**: Redis provides a fast in-memory data store, but it may not be suitable for high write operations required by the flow analysis service. Redisâ€™ TTL (Time-To-Live) feature allows data to expire after a set time, which is beneficial for short-lived data but not ideal for durable data.
2. **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: PostgreSQL is chosen for its robust handling of high-frequency writes and complex queries. It ensures data consistency, durability, and scalability. It's ideal for counting use cases where data integrity is important.
3. **NoSQL (MongoDB)**: MongoDB can handle large amounts of unstructured data but may not be as efficient for operations like counting and aggregations, making it less suited for this particular use case.

### **Decision**
After evaluating the options, **SQL (PostgreSQL)** was chosen for its ability to:
- Handle high-frequency writes and maintain data consistency.
- Provide reliable long-term storage.
- Ensure scalability and robust querying capabilities.

# **Extensions Implemented**

## **Extension 1: Changing GET to POST**
The request method was changed from `GET` to `POST` to handle larger payloads and adhere to RESTful principles.

## **Extension 2: Data Dump to Kafka**
Data dumping was shifted from a log file to **Kafka** for improved scalability and event-driven architecture.

## **Extension 3: Horizontal Scaling with Load Balancer**
To scale the service, multiple instances are deployed behind an **Nginx** load balancer, ensuring traffic distribution.

### **Solution**
- **Load Balancer (Nginx)**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances.
- **Data Consistency**: All instances poll from the same PostgreSQL database for consistent count values.
- **Kafka Message Duplication**: Consumers handle message duplication, ensuring only one message is processed per time window.
